# EventsManager
Events Manager for the Sant Bani School

## What is it?

EventsManager is a quick and easy way to manage your events in a way that makes it compatible for everyone in your workplace to use!

EventsManager is an **open source** project created after the lead developer noticed that a piece of old software that served similar (base) functionality was old, and needed to be replaced.
